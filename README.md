# Visualization-tools-in-Python

This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to various data visualization techniques using the Matplotlib library in Python. We've demonstrated these techniques using both sample data and real-world banking data.

## Introduction

Data visualization is an essential component of data analysis. It allows us to quickly understand the structure of our data and draw preliminary insights. In this notebook, we utilize Matplotlib, a powerful library in Python, to create a variety of plots.

## Basic Visualizations with Sample Data

### Histogram

A histogram showcases the distribution of a dataset. In our sample, we have displayed the test scores of students.

### Boxplot

Boxplots give a five-number summary of our dataset: the minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum. Our sample displays a set of random values.

### Line Chart

Line charts are excellent for understanding trends in a dataset. Our sample consists of two line charts comparing two different datasets.

### Scatter Plot

A scatter plot displays values of two numerical variables as coordinates in two-dimensional space. Our example showcases a random distribution of points.

### Bar Chart

Bar charts help visualize categorical data with rectangular bars. We've included vertical and horizontal bar charts for a sample dataset.

### Pie Chart

Pie charts provide a circular statistical graphic which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions. We've shown the distribution of four sample categories.

## Visualizations with Banking Data

### Account Balances Distribution

A histogram that provides insights into how bank account balances are distributed among customers.

### Dispersion of Loan Amounts

This boxplot showcases the range and spread of loan amounts among those who have taken loans.

### Trend of Account Balances

A line chart that depicts how account balances trend across different customer indices.

### Account Balances vs Loan Amounts

A scatter plot representing the relationship between the account balances of customers and the amount of loan they have taken.

### Distribution of Account Types

A pie chart displaying the proportion of different types of bank accounts.

### Distribution of Loan Statuses

This bar chart provides insights into the distribution of loan statuses among customers, e.g., active, completed, or defaulted.
